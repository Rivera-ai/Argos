Experiment of an Agent that uses OSINT (Open Source INTelligence) to find information about people and create personality profiles or other activities

For obvious reasons, the source code of the implementation will not be published, only demos of the Argos Agent working and its possible ethical implications when developing similar tools.

## Why "Argos"?

The project's name is inspired by Argos Panoptes (Ἄργος Πανόπτης), a figure from Greek mythology known as "the all-seeing" or "the hundred-eyed". According to mythology, Argos was a giant endowed with a hundred eyes distributed throughout his body, allowing him to maintain constant vigilance, as while some eyes slept, others remained awake.

This omnipresent observational capacity of Argos Panoptes reflects the fundamental nature of our OSINT tool, which is designed to collect and analyze information from multiple open sources simultaneously, creating a comprehensive view of available data, just as 'Argos' hundred eyes allowed complete surveillance of his surroundings.


# Disclaimer

It should be noted that this is an "Experiment" and is not intended to be a product or a real demonstration of a system implemented in real life.
